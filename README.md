# Breakout

Small block-breaking breakout clone for a Digital Games class.

In order to play, press Space to launch ball and use either the arrows or AD to move the paddle.

# Features

Wait to launch ball: the ball will stay with the paddle until you press Space. It will then be launched and the game will begin.

Highscore: the player's highscore will be saved and shown on the top of the screen and after every game.

Durable blocks: blocks will have a random durability, evidenced by their colors. White blocks break with 1 hit, blue with 2, green with 3 and yellow with 4. As they get damaged, their color change in order to show how many hits are left for them to break.
